# Mobile-First Admissions Dashboard

## Project Overview

[cite_start]This Power BI dashboard, detailed in the blog post "Building a Mobile-First Admissions Dashboard for University Leadership," describes the creation of a mobile-optimized admissions dashboard for the University of New Haven's leadership, including the University President. 

[cite_start]As a Graduate Data Analyst, the goal was to provide timely, actionable insights into Fall 2025 admissions data (both undergraduate and graduate) that could be easily accessed on a mobile device.  [cite_start]The dashboard tracks various student segments (e.g., New First-Time, Full-Time Students; Transfer, Part-Time Students)  [cite_start]and offers navigation at the college level, allowing drill-downs into specific academic units like the College of Arts & Sciences and Pompea College of Business. 

[cite_start]Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) tracked include applications submitted, completed, accepted, denied, I-20 issued, visa approved, net deposits, and enrolled students, enabling instant year-over-year comparisons between Fall 2024 and Fall 2025. 

## Design Strategy

The dashboard was designed with a mobile-first approach. [cite_start]To optimize for mobile devices with limited screen real estate, custom text labels were placed above KPI cards, saving space and maintaining a clean layout.  [cite_start]Trend arrows were incorporated using DAX measures to visually indicate performance changes between 2024 and 2025, making significant shifts quickly noticeable.  [cite_start]The dashboard also aligns with the university's brand identity by incorporating "Charger Blue and Yellow" colors and a "Powered by Charger" footer. 

## Key Features & Visuals

Here are selected screens from the dashboard illustrating the mobile-first design and core functionality:
